armchrome-archer
================

Prepares usb stick, sdcard, or internal mmc for arch arm and installs basic system. Can run from a chrome device, linux machine, or whatever. Just mind your device paths and make sure the bins it needs are in place. This does need root. Maybe sudo will work. 

To run, just run ./archer.sh

The script will ask you for a device name.

Requires at least a 1GB storage device. Boot only works from the usb 2 (not blue) port. Make sure you hit ctrl_u at the white dev mode screen.
